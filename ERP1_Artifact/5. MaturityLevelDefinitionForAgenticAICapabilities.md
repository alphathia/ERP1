
# Maturity Level Definition for Agentic AI Capabilities Taxonomy

## Methodological Foundation

### Core Principle: Capability vs. Maturity Distinction

| Construct | Definition | Assessment Question |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Capability Characteristic** (C_.1-C_.4) | *What* the system can do — the type/sophistication of capability | "What category of capability does this system exhibit?" |
| **Maturity Level** (1-5) | *How well* the system implements that capability — reliability, consistency, optimization | "How effectively and reliably does this system deliver this capability?" |

**Example**: Two systems both classified at C1.3 (Multi-Path Exploration) could have different maturity levels:
- **Level 2**: Generates multiple paths inconsistently; path selection is unreliable
- **Level 4**: Generates multiple paths systematically; path selection is measured and optimized

### Maturity Framework Structure (CMM-Style)

| **2** | Developing | Capability repeatable in limited contexts; emerging patterns | Emerging value signals; context-dependent |
| **3** | Defined | Capability standardized, consistently applied, documented | Demonstrable, consistent value; measurable ROI |
| **4** | Managed | Capability measured, optimized, quantitatively controlled | Significant quantified value; predictable outcomes |
| **5** | Optimizing | Capability continuously improved; drives strategic advantage | Transformative/strategic value; competitive differentiation |

## 5.3 Reference Object Maturity Assessment

### Assessment Methodology

For each object, I assess maturity level per dimension based on:
1. **Characteristic level** (C_.1-C_.4) as baseline indicator
2. **Implementation quality** as described in corpus
3. **Value realization evidence** from documented deployments

### Characteristic-to-Maturity Baseline Mapping

Since characteristics indicate *what* capability and maturity indicates *how well*, I use this baseline guidance:

| Characteristic Level | Typical Maturity Range | Rationale |
|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|
| C_.1 (Baseline) | Level 1-2 | Basic capability, typically immature implementation |
| C_.2 (Emerging) | Level 2-3 | Functional capability, developing maturity |
| C_.3 (Competent) | Level 3-4 | Sophisticated capability, defined to managed |
| C_.4 (Expert) | Level 3-5 | Advanced capability, varies by implementation quality |

**Note**: This is a baseline—actual maturity depends on implementation evidence.

| **D7: Human Collaboration** | User frustration; adoption resistance; trust deficit | Synergistic partnership; exceeded expectations; strategic human-AI advantage | Low maturity = adoption barrier; each level increases adoption ~30%; L5 enables true teaming |
| **D8: Compliance** | Regulatory risk; deployment blocked; liability exposure | Sustained trust; high-stakes deployment enabled; compliance cost reduction | Low maturity = deployment blocker; L3+ required for enterprise; L5 enables regulated industry deployment |
| **D9: Safety** | Liability exposure; reputational risk; incidents likely | Comprehensive protection; high-capability deployment enabled; trust asset | Low maturity = deployment blocker; each level reduces incident rate ~5x; L5 enables full autonomy |

### Cross-Dimension Value Multiplication

**Key Insight from Corpus**: Liu et al. (2025) - Agentic ROI defines value as information gain divided by interaction costs. Maturity affects both:

$$\text{Agentic ROI} = \frac{\text{Information Gain}}{\text{Interaction Cost} + \text{Agent Expense}}$$

| Maturity Factor | Impact on Numerator | Impact on Denominator | Net Effect |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| **Reasoning (D1)** | ↑ Quality of information gain | ↓ Rework/correction costs | Strong positive |
| **Tool Integration (D2)** | ↑ Scope of information gain | ↓ Manual intervention | Strong positive |
| **Memory (D3)** | ↑ Cumulative information | ↓ Context repetition | Moderate positive |
| **Coordination (D4)** | ↑ Scale of information | ↑/↓ Coordination overhead | Conditional |
| **Autonomy (D5)** | ↑ Continuous information | ↓ Oversight costs | Strong positive |
| **Adaptation (D6)** | ↑ Improving information | ↓ Training costs | Strong positive |
| **Collaboration (D7)** | ↑ Trust-enabled information | ↓ Friction/rework | Moderate positive |
| **Compliance (D8)** | Enables deployment | ↓ Regulatory costs | Enabling |
| **Safety (D9)** | Enables deployment | ↓ Incident costs | Enabling |

### Critical Maturity Thresholds

Based on corpus evidence, certain maturity thresholds are critical for value realization:

| Threshold | Dimension(s) | Rationale | Corpus Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Deployment Threshold** | D8 ≥ L3, D9 ≥ L3 | Minimum for enterprise deployment | Mohammadi et al. (2025): Enterprise requirements include RBAC, audit trails |
| **Positive ROI Threshold** | D1 ≥ L3, D2 ≥ L2 | Minimum for net positive value | Liu et al. (2025): Agentic ROI requires sufficient information gain |
| **Scaling Threshold** | D5 ≥ L3, D7 ≥ L3 | Required for reduced oversight | McKinsey (2025): Scaling requires workflow redesign |
| **Strategic Value Threshold** | Average ≥ L4 | Required for transformative impact | McKinsey (2025): >5% EBIT attribution from high-performing organizations |

## Maturity Assessment Guide for Practitioners

### Quick Assessment Process

**Step 1: Identify Capability Characteristics**
For each dimension, classify the system at C_.1, C_.2, C_.3, or C_.4 using the taxonomy.

**Step 2: Assess Implementation Quality**
For each dimension, evaluate maturity (L1-L5) based on:

| Assessment Factor | L1-2 Indicators | L3 Indicators | L4-5 Indicators |
|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Reliability** | Inconsistent, frequent failures | Consistent in defined scope | Near-perfect, continuous improvement |
| **Measurement** | No metrics | Basic metrics tracked | Comprehensive, optimized based on data |
| **Documentation** | Ad-hoc | Standardized procedures | Continuous refinement based on outcomes |
| **Value Evidence** | Anecdotal or negative | Demonstrable, measurable | Quantified, strategic |

**Step 3: Calculate Profile**
- Record maturity level per dimension
- Identify gaps (dimensions with maturity significantly below average)
- Flag critical thresholds (D8/D9 < L3 blocks enterprise deployment)

**Step 4: Prioritize Improvement**
- Address deployment blockers first (D8, D9)
- Then improve dimensions with highest value leverage for use case
- Consider interdependencies (e.g., D5 autonomy requires D8/D9 safety/compliance)
