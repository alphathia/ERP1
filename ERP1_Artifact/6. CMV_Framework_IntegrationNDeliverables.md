### DIMENSION D4: Coordination Paradigm

```
CAPABILITY                    MECHANISM                         ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT              MEASURABLE VALUE                    KPIs
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                                                                                                    Collective intelligence              • Consensus accuracy
                                                                                                    through diverse perspectives         • Verification coverage
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    INNOVATION ENABLEMENT:           →   • Novel problem

                                                                                                    from agent combinations
```

**Value Amplification Logic**: Coordination creates non-linear value—poorly implemented coordination (Level 1-2) can yield negative value (worse than single agent). At Level 3+, positive ROI emerges. At Level 5, collective intelligence enables capability multiplication exceeding sum of parts.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Goal creation, task      →    Agent independently            →   Reduces human oversight        →   PRODUCTIVITY GAIN:               →   • Human intervention

                                                                 scaling                            RISK CONSIDERATION:              →   • Escalation
                                                                                                    Higher autonomy requires             appropriateness %
                                                                                                    commensurate governance              • Boundary compliance
```

**Value Amplification Logic**: Each autonomy level reduces human oversight requirement by 20-30%. However, autonomy creates a risk-value trade-off: high autonomy (Level 4-5) without corresponding governance (D8-D9) creates risk exposure that can negate value gains. Balanced autonomy-governance is essential.

```

**Value Amplification Logic**: Collaboration quality is the critical mediator between capability and actual value realization. Poor collaboration (Level 1-2) creates adoption barriers that prevent capable systems from delivering value. Each level increases adoption approximately 30%. Level 5 enables true human-AI partnership with synergistic performance.

                                                                                                    for enterprise deployment            readiness score
```

**Value Amplification Logic**: Compliance is a **threshold enabler**—insufficient compliance (Level 1-2) blocks enterprise deployment entirely, preventing any value realization. Level 3+ unlocks deployment. Level 4-5 enables high-stakes regulated industry deployment with strategic trust advantages.

```

**Value Amplification Logic**: Safety is a **threshold enabler** similar to compliance. Each maturity level reduces incident rate approximately 5x. Level 1-2 creates liability exposure blocking deployment. Level 3+ enables enterprise deployment. Level 4-5 enables deployment of high-capability autonomous systems with strategic trust advantages.

## 6.7 Executive Summary

### Agentic AI Capability-Maturity-Value (CMV) Framework
#### Executive Summary

**Purpose and Audience**

The Agentic AI CMV Framework provides a systematic approach for classifying, assessing, and evaluating the value potential of AI systems with autonomous decision-making capabilities. The framework serves three primary user groups: researchers seeking a common vocabulary for comparing agentic AI systems; practitioners and architects making design and implementation decisions; and enterprise leaders evaluating AI investments and deployment readiness. Unlike existing frameworks that focus narrowly on technical performance or safety thresholds, this CMV framework explicitly integrates organizational value creation as the central organizing principle.

**Methodology**

The framework was developed following the rigorous taxonomy development methodology of Nickerson et al. (2013), recognized as the gold standard in information systems research. Through three iterations alternating between empirical-to-conceptual and conceptual-to-empirical approaches, the taxonomy achieved all objective and subjective ending conditions including mutual exclusivity, collective exhaustivity, conciseness, robustness, and explanatory power. The framework synthesizes insights from 20+ academic and industry sources including agent design patterns (Liu et al., 2025), evaluation benchmarks (Mohammadi et al., 2025), AGI capability levels (Morris et al., 2024), safety frameworks (OpenAI Preparedness Framework), and enterprise deployment research (McKinsey, 2025).

**Key Dimensions**

The taxonomy identifies nine capability dimensions essential for value creation: Reasoning Sophistication (cognitive processes for analysis and problem-solving), Tool Integration Depth (external system connectivity), Memory Persistence (information retention across interactions), Coordination Paradigm (multi-agent organizational structures), Autonomy Level (human-agent decision authority distribution), Adaptation Mechanism (performance improvement over time), Human Collaboration Mode (interaction patterns with users), Compliance & Alignment Posture (policy and regulatory adherence), and Safety Architecture (protective mechanisms against harm). Each dimension contains four hierarchical characteristics representing progressive capability levels.

**Value Creation Mechanisms**

The framework maps capabilities to seven organizational value categories: revenue enhancement, cost reduction, risk mitigation, productivity improvement, decision quality enhancement, safety assurance, and innovation enablement. Critical findings include the identification of threshold dimensions (Compliance and Safety at Level 3+ required for enterprise deployment), the autonomy-governance balance principle (high autonomy requires commensurate governance maturity), and value multiplication effects where maturity improvements compound across dimensions.

**Framework Application**

Practitioners can apply the CMV framework through the Assessment Scorecard to classify systems across all nine dimensions, assess implementation maturity (Levels 1-5), identify capability gaps, and prioritize improvement investments based on value potential. The framework reveals that current agentic AI systems cluster at Defined maturity (Level 3), with advanced capabilities in memory, coordination, and continuous learning remaining relatively rare. Software engineering and ERP integration represent the highest-ROI deployment domains in the current landscape.

**Limitations and Future Development**

The framework is grounded in literature available through mid-2025 and requires ongoing validation as the field evolves. Key research gaps include limited empirical quantification of maturity-to-value correlations, sparse evidence for Level 4-5 maturity criteria in coordination and adaptation dimensions, and incomplete understanding of cross-dimensional maturity interactions. Future development should prioritize longitudinal deployment studies, autonomy-governance balance quantification, and expansion of reference objects as new agentic AI systems emerge.
