### Objective Ending Conditions

| Condition | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| All objects examined | ☑ **Met** | 25/25 objects classified |
| No objects merged/split this iteration | ☑ **Met** | No object changes; O12 reclassified only |
| At least one object per characteristic | ☑ **Met** | All 36 characteristics have ≥1 object (C3.3 has 2: O12, O17) |
| No new dimensions added this iteration | ☐ **Not Met** | D9 (Safety Architecture) added by splitting D8 |
| No dimensions/characteristics merged/split | ☐ **Not Met** | D8 split into D8 + D9 |
| Every dimension unique | ☑ **Met** | 9 dimensions with distinct conceptual scope; D8/D9 split resolved prior overlap |
| Every characteristic unique within dimension | ☑ **Met** | All characteristics clearly differentiated |
| Each cell combination unique | ☑ **Met** | All 25 objects have unique 9-dimensional profiles |

### Characteristic Population Analysis

| Dimension | C_.1 | C_.2 | C_.3 | C_.4 | Total |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| D1: Reasoning | 2 | 13 | 7 | 3 | 25 |
| D2: Tool Integration | 5 | 7 | 10 | 3 | 25 |
| D3: Memory | 11 | 10 | 2 | 2 | 25 |
| D4: Coordination | 17 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 25 |
| D5: Autonomy | 3 | 4 | 13 | 5 | 25 |
| D6: Adaptation | 4 | 12 | 7 | 2 | 25 |
| D7: Human Collaboration | 4 | 12 | 7 | 2 | 25 |
| D8: Compliance | 4 | 14 | 5 | 2 | 25 |
| D9: Safety | 3 | 13 | 7 | 2 | 25 |

**Observations**:
- **Skewed distributions** in D3 (Memory) and D4 (Coordination): Most objects cluster at lower characteristic levels, reflecting current state of agentic AI development
- **C3.3 and C3.4** remain sparse (2 objects each) but now meet minimum threshold
- **C4.3 and C4.4** sparse (2 objects each) reflecting that multi-agent systems are less common in the corpus
- These distributions are **empirically valid**—they reflect the actual state of agentic AI systems in the literature

### Subjective Ending Conditions

| Condition | Assessment | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Concise** (5-9 dimensions) | ☑ **Met** | 9 dimensions—at upper bound but justified by Compliance/Safety conceptual distinction |
| **Robust** (differentiates objects) | ☑ **Met** | All 25 objects have unique 9-dimensional classification profiles |
| **Comprehensive** (all objects classifiable) | ☑ **Met** | Every object assigned to exactly one characteristic per dimension |
| **Extendible** (new objects could fit) | ☑ **Met** | Characteristics span full range; Object Type annotation handles diverse entity types |
| **Explanatory** (explains capability-value relationships) | ☑ **Met** | Comprehensive Capability-Characteristics-Value-Expectation table established and approved |
