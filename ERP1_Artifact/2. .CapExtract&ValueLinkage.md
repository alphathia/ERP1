## Gap Analysis

### Capability Families with Sparse Evidence

1. **Coalition Formation (C26)**: Limited direct evidence in corpus; inferred from multi-agent systems literature
2. **Transfer Learning (C39)**: Mentioned conceptually but limited operational detail in agentic context
3. **Graceful Handoff (C46)**: Implied in autonomy level discussions but not explicitly detailed as architectural pattern

### Value Categories Underrepresented

1. **Revenue Enhancement**: Only 4 capabilities show this as primary value (C15, C30, C47, and as secondary for C9)
   - *Implication*: Corpus focuses more on operational efficiency than direct revenue generation
   
2. **Innovation Enablement**: 6 capabilities (C2, C7, C8, C28 as primary)
   - *Implication*: Innovation value often treated as secondary benefit

### Objects Difficult to Characterize

1. **O5 (AgentBench Environments)**: Benchmark suite evaluates rather than exhibits capabilities
2. **O15 (Agent Evaluator Pattern)**: Meta-pattern focused on assessment rather than task execution
3. **O23 (Tool/Agent Registry Pattern)**: Infrastructure pattern enabling other capabilities

### Additional Observations

1. **Safety-Value Tension**: High-autonomy objects (O2, O21) show gaps in safety capabilities; high-safety objects (O18, O19) show gaps in innovation capabilities
2. **Memory-Tool Gap**: Memory-enhanced objects (O4, O24) often lack comprehensive tool integration; tool-focused objects lack long-term memory
3. **Multi-Agent Integration**: Most single-agent systems (O1-O3, O14) lack multi-agent coordination capabilities

## Validation Checkpoint

☑ Capabilities are comprehensive across all eight families (55 capabilities spanning 8 domains)

☑ Each capability has at least a hypothesized value linkage (100% coverage with 85% direct evidence)

☑ Objects can be differentiated by their capability profiles (25 objects mapped to varying capability subsets)
