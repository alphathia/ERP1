# Taxonomy Refinement — Iteration 3

## Iteration 3 Summary

- **Selected Approach**: **Conceptual-to-Empirical**
- **Rationale**: Iteration 2 achieved structural stability with all objects classified. The remaining task is to validate conceptual completeness through gap analysis against theoretical frameworks in the literature, ensuring no critical dimensions are missing before finalizing the taxonomy.

---

## Task 4.1: Address Identified Issues from Iteration 2

Reviewing the Iteration 2 Ending Conditions Assessment:

| Issue | Resolution Approach | Changes Made |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| **D9 added (Not Met condition)** | This was an approved structural change, not an issue | No further action—documented as design decision |
| **D8 split (Not Met condition)** | This was an approved structural change, not an issue | No further action—documented as design decision |
| **Skewed distributions in D3, D4** | Validated as empirically accurate—reflects current state of agentic AI | No changes—distributions are valid representations of the corpus |
| **C3.3, C3.4, C4.3, C4.4 sparse** | All now meet minimum threshold (≥2 objects each) | No changes—sparse but valid |

**Assessment**: No unresolved issues from Iteration 2 requiring correction. The "Not Met" conditions were expected outcomes of approved changes, not quality defects.

## Task 4.2: Dimension/Characteristic Modifications

### Modifications This Iteration

**Dimensions Added**: None

**Dimensions Merged**: None

**Dimensions Split**: None

**Dimensions Removed**: None

**Characteristics Modified**: None

**Rationale**: The Iteration 2 taxonomy achieved structural completeness. Task 4.3 (Gap Analysis) will determine if any additions are warranted.

## Task 4.3: Gap Analysis

### Systematic Coverage Check

I will evaluate each suggested dimension against the current taxonomy to identify any gaps:

| Suggested Dimension | Current Coverage | Gap Assessment | Action |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| **Autonomy Level** | D5: Autonomy Level (C5.1-C5.4) | ☑ Fully covered | None required |
| **Temporal Scope** | Partially covered by D3: Memory Persistence (temporal retention) | ⚠️ Partial gap: D3 captures *memory* temporal scope, but not *planning horizon* (real-time vs. long-horizon planning) | Evaluate below |
| **Interaction Mode** | D7: Human Collaboration Mode (C7.1-C7.4) | ☑ Fully covered | None required |
| **Learning Mechanism** | D6: Adaptation Mechanism (C6.1-C6.4) | ☑ Fully covered | None required |
| **Collaboration Type** | D4: Coordination Paradigm (C4.1-C4.4) | ☑ Fully covered | None required |
| **Governance/Safety** | D8: Compliance & Alignment + D9: Safety Architecture | ☑ Fully covered (split in Iteration 2) | None required |
| **Domain Specialization** | Not explicitly covered | ⚠️ Potential gap: General-purpose vs. vertical/domain-specific agents | Evaluate below |
| **Deployment Context** | Not explicitly covered | ⚠️ Potential gap: Experimental vs. pilot vs. production deployment | Evaluate below |

---

### Gap Evaluation: Temporal Scope (Planning Horizon)

**Question**: Should "Planning Horizon" be a separate dimension from "Memory Persistence"?

**Analysis**:

| Aspect | Memory Persistence (D3) | Planning Horizon (Proposed) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Focus | How long information is *retained* | How far ahead the agent *plans* |
| Example | Session memory vs. cross-session | Real-time response vs. multi-day project planning |
| Overlap | Long-horizon tasks require memory, but memory doesn't guarantee long planning | Distinct concepts |

**Validation Against Objects**:

| Object | D3 (Memory) | Planning Horizon (if added) | Are these independent? |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| O1 (ReAct) | C3.1 (Context-only) | Short (step-by-step) | Yes—could have short planning with long memory |
| O4 (Generative Agents) | C3.4 (Comprehensive) | Medium (daily schedules) | Yes—memory enables but doesn't determine horizon |
| O14 (Deep Research) | C3.2 (Session) | Long (multi-day research) | Yes—long planning with session memory |
| O10 (AIOps) | C3.2 (Session) | Short-to-Medium (incident response) | Yes—independent dimensions |

**Decision**: Planning Horizon is conceptually distinct from Memory Persistence. However, reviewing the corpus and meta-characteristic:

1. **Corpus evidence**: The corpus discusses planning primarily in terms of *reasoning quality* (D1) and *task decomposition* rather than temporal horizon as a separate concern
2. **Meta-characteristic alignment**: Planning horizon affects value primarily through its interaction with other dimensions (reasoning + memory + autonomy) rather than as an independent value driver
3. **Parsimony principle**: Adding a 10th dimension would exceed the 5-9 guideline

**Conclusion**: **Do not add** Planning Horizon as a separate dimension. The current taxonomy captures the value-relevant aspects through D1 (Reasoning—task decomposition), D3 (Memory—temporal retention), and D5 (Autonomy—goal pursuit duration). 

[ASSUMPTION]: Planning horizon is adequately captured as an emergent property of D1+D3+D5 combinations rather than an independent dimension. User may override if explicit planning horizon classification is required.

---

### Gap Evaluation: Domain Specialization

**Question**: Should "Domain Specialization" (general-purpose vs. vertical) be a separate dimension?

**Analysis**:

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| **Value relevance** | Domain specialization affects *where* value is created but may not independently determine *how much* value |
| **Current coverage** | Object Type annotation already captures application domains (AIOps, Software Engineering, ERP, Industry 4.0) |
| **Mutual exclusivity challenge** | An agent could be both domain-specialized AND general-purpose (e.g., GPT-4 fine-tuned for legal) |
| **Corpus evidence** | Domain discussed as application context rather than capability dimension |

**Validation Against Objects**:

| Object | Domain | Would adding dimension change classification? |
|--------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| O10 (AIOps) | IT Operations (vertical) | Already differentiated by D2.3, D8.3, D9.3 |
| O11 (SW Engineering) | Software Development (vertical) | Already differentiated by D2.3, D6.2 |
| O12 (ERP) | Enterprise Functions (vertical) | Already differentiated by D2.4, D3.3, D8.3 |
| O25 (Industry 4.0) | Manufacturing (vertical) | Already differentiated by D2.4, D4.4, D8.4, D9.4 |
| O2 (AutoGPT) | General-purpose | Already differentiated by D5.4, D8.1, D9.1 |

**Decision**: **Do not add** Domain Specialization as a separate dimension.

**Rationale**:
1. Domain differences are already captured through differential capability profiles (e.g., ERP agents have higher tool integration, compliance, and memory)
2. Adding domain would conflate *application context* with *capability characteristics*
3. Object Type annotation already provides domain information for filtering/analysis
4. A domain dimension would face mutual exclusivity challenges

---

### Gap Evaluation: Deployment Context

**Question**: Should "Deployment Context" (experimental → pilot → production) be a separate dimension?

**Analysis**:

| Consideration | Assessment |
|---------------|------------|
| **Value relevance** | Deployment stage significantly affects value realization potential |
| **Current coverage** | Partially implied by D8 (Compliance) and D9 (Safety)—production requires higher levels |
| **Meta-characteristic alignment** | Deployment context is a *moderator* of value realization, not a *capability* |
| **Taxonomic fit** | Deployment stage describes *implementation maturity*, which may belong in the CMV Maturity Model rather than the Capability Taxonomy |

**Validation Against Objects**:

| Object | Implied Deployment Stage | Current Classification Signals |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| O2 (AutoGPT) | Experimental | D8.1, D9.1 (ungoverned, unprotected) |
| O19 (Safeguarded Models) | Production-ready | D8.4, D9.4 (comprehensive governance + safety) |
| O11 (SW Engineering) | Pilot-to-Production | D8.2, D9.2 (basic protections) |
| O25 (Industry 4.0) | Production | D8.4, D9.4 (enterprise-grade) |

**Decision**: **Do not add** Deployment Context as a separate dimension in the Capability Taxonomy.

**Rationale**:
1. Deployment stage is better addressed in the **Maturity Model** (Prompt 5) rather than the Capability Taxonomy
2. Current D8+D9 classifications implicitly signal deployment readiness
3. Adding deployment would conflate *capability characteristics* with *implementation state*
4. Deployment stage is time-variant for a given system; capability characteristics should be more stable

**Documentation**: Deployment Context will be addressed explicitly in the Maturity Integration phase (Prompt 5) as part of the Capability-Maturity-Value framework.

---

### Gap Analysis Summary

| Proposed Dimension | Decision | Rationale |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|
| Planning Horizon | **Not Added** | Emergent property of D1+D3+D5; would exceed dimension limit |
| Domain Specialization | **Not Added** | Captured by Object Type annotation and differential capability profiles |
| Deployment Context | **Not Added** | Belongs in Maturity Model (Prompt 5); implied by D8+D9 levels |

**Conclusion**: The 9-dimension taxonomy is conceptually complete for capability classification. No additional dimensions are warranted based on gap analysis.

## Task 4.4: Final Taxonomy (Iteration 3 — No Changes)

Since no modifications were made in Iteration 3, the taxonomy remains as established in Iteration 2.

| **D8** | Compliance & Alignment Posture | The degree to which an agent operates within organizational policies, regulatory requirements, ethical standards, and intended value alignment | Robust compliance enables enterprise deployment by ensuring regulatory adherence, policy conformance, and sustained alignment with organizational values | OpenAI Preparedness Framework; Mohammadi et al. (2025); Liu et al. (2025); Acharya et al. (2025) |
| **D9** | Safety Architecture | The comprehensiveness of mechanisms protecting against harmful outputs, adversarial attacks, system failures, and unintended consequences | Comprehensive safety architecture is prerequisite for scaled deployment, protecting against liability, operational disruption, and reputational harm | OpenAI Preparedness Framework; Mohammadi et al. (2025); Piccialli et al. (2025) |

### Characteristic Population Analysis (Final)

| Dimension | C_.1 | C_.2 | C_.3 | C_.4 | Distribution Assessment |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------------------------|
| D1: Reasoning | 2 | 13 | 7 | 3 | Concentrated at C1.2; empirically valid |
| D2: Tool Integration | 5 | 7 | 10 | 3 | Well-distributed; slight concentration at C2.3 |
| D3: Memory | 11 | 10 | 2 | 2 | Concentrated at C3.1-C3.2; advanced memory rare |
| D4: Coordination | 17 | 4 | 2 | 2 | Concentrated at C4.1; multi-agent systems rare |
| D5: Autonomy | 3 | 4 | 13 | 5 | Well-distributed; slight concentration at C5.3 |
| D6: Adaptation | 4 | 12 | 7 | 2 | Concentrated at C6.2; continuous learning rare |
| D7: Human Collaboration | 4 | 12 | 7 | 2 | Concentrated at C7.2; bidirectional teaming rare |
| D8: Compliance | 4 | 14 | 5 | 2 | Concentrated at C8.2; full governance rare |
| D9: Safety | 3 | 13 | 7 | 2 | Concentrated at C9.2; defense-in-depth rare |

**Observation**: Distributions reflect the **current empirical state of agentic AI development**—most systems operate at intermediate capability levels with advanced capabilities (comprehensive memory, dynamic coalitions, continuous learning, defense-in-depth safety) being relatively rare. This is an accurate representation, not a taxonomic defect.

## Iteration 3 Decision

### ☑ **TERMINATE — All Ending Conditions Met**

**Summary**:
- **Objective conditions**: 8/8 met
- **Subjective conditions**: 5/5 met
- **Gap analysis**: Completed; no additional dimensions required
- **Stability**: No changes made in Iteration 3; taxonomy is stable

## Final Taxonomy Certification

The Agentic AI Capability Taxonomy is certified as complete under the Nickerson et al. (2013) methodology:

### Formal Definition

$$T = \{D_i, i = 1,...,9 \mid D_i = \{C_{ij}, j = 1,...,4\}\}$$

Where:
- T = Agentic AI Capability Taxonomy
- $D_i$ = Dimension i (9 dimensions: D1-D9)
- $C_{ij}$ = Characteristic j within Dimension i (4 characteristics per dimension)

### Taxonomy Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Dimensions | 9 |
| Characteristics per dimension | 4 |
| Total characteristics | 36 |
| Reference objects classified | 25 |
| Unique object profiles | 25 (100%) |
| Iterations to convergence | 3 |
| Object Types defined | 6 |

### Design Decisions Documented

| Decision | Iteration | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 8 initial dimensions from capability families | 1 | Empirical-to-conceptual mapping from Phase 2 |
| D8 split into D8 (Compliance) + D9 (Safety) | 2 | Conceptual distinction per user directive |
| Object Type as annotation (not dimension) | 2 | Preserves capability focus; accommodates entity diversity |
| C3.3 retained as legitimately rare | 2 | Valid transitional characteristic; O12, O17 instances |
| O12 reclassified (D3→C3.3, D7→C7.3) | 2 | ERP agents require long-term memory and explanatory collaboration |
| D1/D4/D5 definitions hardened | 2 | Ensures mutual exclusivity across reasoning/coordination/autonomy |
| No additional dimensions after gap analysis | 3 | Planning horizon, domain, deployment context adequately covered |
